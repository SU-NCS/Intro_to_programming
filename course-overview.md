### Session 1: What's a program? What is Python?

This week we take a high level view of programming. We also introduce Python, what it is, where it comes from, and why we're using it. We also how to setup Python on CodeAnywhere.

#### Activity 1: What's a program?

In this session we take a high level view of programming. We also introduce Python, what it is, where it comes from, and why we're using it.

* Introduce the concepts of **sequencing**, acting on **conditional** tests, **looping**, and **I/O** used as applied to everyday activities
* Introduce the concepts of Input/Output and discuss local I/O with the **console**,  **files** and **remote** I/O via the Internet with API's

#### Activity 2: Setup Dev Environment for Python 3 and Write Code

In the second activity for this week, we setup a development environment,  introduce variables and write our first program.

### Session 2: Sequencing, Variables and Types, Console I/O

In this session we use variables and to gather information of different types form the console.  We also introduce the way in with sequencing of instructions creates the flow of the program.  

#### Activity 1: Write a program to introduce yourself

#### Activity 2: Write a Challenge for the Adventure Game using Console I/O

#### Activity 3: Introduce the Adventure Game and add a Challenge

## Week 2

---

This week we will learn how to program with logic in order to form conditional tests. We'll expand on logic to create loops which will run a set of instructions repeatedly until a logical condition is met. We'll introduce our adventure game and learn how to code challenges that will help to play the game.

For our adventure game we need to code Challenges. Challenges are presented to the Player by a Creature in an Episode. The Challenge is a question and if the Player answers it correctly he or she can advance to the next Episode. Along the way the Player can get Treasures and put them into a Knapsack. If the Player makes it through all Episodes they win the game.

In the Activities this week, we write programs that can be run as Challenges inside the game.

### Session 1: Logic: Conditional Tests

In the first activity for this week, we introduce the comparison and logcial operators which can be used to make decisions inside a program.

We'll learn to create expressions with logical operators that can be tested with "**if**" to determine whether to proceed with further instructions.

We'll use Comparison and Logical operators  the  "**for**" loop and the "**while**" loop to run instructions multiple times. The operators will help the code decide when to start and stop a loop.

#### Activity 1: Demo How Game uses Logic and Sequencing to Control the Flow of the Program

Identify sections of the Adventure Game framework that use conditional tests.

##### Exercise:

* Create a flow chart that shows the flow of a set of instructions based on logical tests
* Use conditional operators \(&lt;, &gt;, ==, &lt;=, and &gt;=\) to create logical expressions
* Show tests for equality with different types
* Use "if" to determine program flow

#### Activity 2: Write a Challenge that uses conditional tests

In this Challenge we'll be able to test if the user responds correctly and provide feedback.

### Session 2: Looping and Functions

#### Activity 1: Demo how to create a guessing game Challenge that uses Looping

Identify sections of the Adventure Game framework that loop. Show

* how the loop is intiated 
* what keeps it going 
* how the loop is terminated

##### Exercise:

* Create a while loop
* Create a for loop
* Describe the difference between a for loop and a while loop

#### Activity 2: Functions

Functions help to organize code and prevent duplicating code through the program. A function is a named chunk of code that can be called from another section of the program. It can define parameters which are variables that will be passed to it when called. Functions can also return values.

We'll do exercises in which write and call functions with parameters and return values. For example we can write a function that takes two numbers, adds them together and returns the sum. We'll also incoporate functions into the code we write for the Challenge.

##### Exercise:

* Create and call a function that has no parameters and returns nothing
* Create and call a  function that has parameters and returns a value

## Week 3

---

This week use Python to get information about the computer. We'll also learn how read files, process data and write data out to files. These activities help to understand computer I/O and CPU usage. The ability to save data will allow us to create data driven applications.

### Session 1: Read and Write Files

#### Activity 1: Review Computer Architecture to Understand File I/O on the Computer

##### Exercise:

* Open a file and write text to it
* Open a file, read text and output to Console
* Write a function that takes a filename as a parameter and returns the contents of the file

#### Activity 2: Use Code to find out information about the Computer

##### Exercise:

Use the sys library to find out

* platform
* windows version
* PATH 
* python version

#### Activity 3: Using Regex \(Regular Expressions\) and Working with Text

Logs

Searching for strings, Counting occurrences

open\(\)/close\(\) vs with\(\)

### Session 2: Read and Process Data

#### Activity 1: Read Data from the Internet

##### Exercise:

* Use [http://numbersapi.com](http://numbersapi.com) to get information about number in JSON format
* Get a number from the user
* Return information about the number

#### Activity 2: Challenge

Open files to decipher what creature is saying - player would have to choose the right key file

Function to encrypt the creature introduction

### Session 1: Creating and Using Objects

#### Activity 1: Demo how the Adventure Game uses Objects

JSON

### Activity 2: Libraries

We'll review some of the libraries that we've used in previous sessions and talk about what other libraries are available. We'll practice installing libraries with **pip **and then importing and using in a program.

##### Exercise:
