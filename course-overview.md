# Week 1:

## Session 1: What's a program? What is Python?

This week we take a high level view of programming. We also introduce Python, what it is, where it comes from, and why we're using it. We also how to setup Python on CodeAnywhere.

## Activity 1: What's a program?

This week we take a high level view of programming. We also introduce Python, what it is, where it comes from, and why we're using it.

* Pen & paper—create set of instructions to do a task
* Give your instructions to another group
* Act out instructions & generalize
* Discussion—groups explain what they did.

## Activity 2: Intro to Repl.it & Python3

In the second activity for this week, we introduces variables and write our first program.

* Challenge: Sign up for CodeAnywhere and create first Python program \(introduce self\)
* Understand what a variable is and how to create one
* Understand basic data types such as numbers and strings
* Learn basic syntax print, variables, operators, string & integrate, import
* Create a program to introduce yourself: "Hello my name is \_\_\_\_\_"

# Week 2:

This week we will learn logic in order to form conditional tests.  We'll expand on logic to create loop swhich will run a set of instructions repeatedly until a logical condition is met.  We'll introduce our adventure game and learn how to code challenges that will help to play the game.

## Activity 1: Logic Game/Flow control
