### The Code Anywhere environment:

Using the Connection Wizard create an environment named "Default" and search for "Python 3".  Click on the "Python 3/Ubuntu" stack to create your Python environemnt. It may take a few minutes to create.

We communicate with the operating system by typing commands into the console. To pen the console right click on the name "Default" and then click on "SSH Terminal":

### Creating files in the Code Anywhere file System

You can right click on the Default Connection and then choose "Create File".  You'll be prompted to enter a name.  Enter **test.py**.  The "py" extension is what makes the operating system recognize this as a Python script.

### Useful Editing Keystrokes for Windows

These keystrokes work on any text file in Windows.

Select all text on a page: **CTRL-A**

Copy to buffer: Select text using mouse or track pad and click** CTRL-C**

Paste from buffer: **CTRL-V**

Go to beginning of line:  **HOME**

Go to end of line: **END**

Go to beginning of file:** CTRL-HOME**

Go to end of file: **CTRL-END**

### Excercises:

Output to Screen: Getting familiar with the print statement

Open the SSH Terminal by right clicking on the Default project and clicking on **SSH Terminal.**

The SSH Terminal is sometime called the Console and this is where Screen output goes when we execute a program from the command line that uses the **Print** statement.

### Command Line

At the Command Line, which is sometimes referred to as a CLI or Command Line Interface, type **python** to enter the interactive Python interpreter mode.  In this interactive mode, Python will immediately process your command and return output. When you get the interpreter prompt \(**&gt;&gt;&gt;**\) type the following and notice what happens.

`print ("hi")`

Replace \_\_\_\_ with your name in the following

`print ("hi ____")   `

What is the affect of the **\n**

`print ("hi \n  My name is ___")`

What is the effect of separating our output with commas?

`print ("hi","\n", "My name is ____")`

Is the computer really adding 1 and 1 below?

`print ("1 + 1 = 2")`







Go to the test.py file your created.

Enter
