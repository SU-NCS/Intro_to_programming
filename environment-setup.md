# Environment Setup

We'll use these tools in setting up the development environment.   The tools include:

**Python 3**: A interpreter for Python 3 code

**Git**: A file versioning program that provides a bash command line interface when working on Windows

**Visual Studio Code**: An interactive development environment



### Python 3

# Download and Install Git

[https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

This will install a Folder with a number of file and programs.

Open a bash window \(`terminal` on Mac or '`git bash`' on Windows\) and type in

`git --version`

This should return a confirmation that git is installed with a version number.
