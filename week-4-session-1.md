#### Activity 4: Intro to Objects

Objects allow us to define code in the way we would define an object in real life.

Objects are nouns and can be described by their parts, or characteristics \(adjectives\) and what they can do \(verbs\)

The code is a template for the object, and when we want to use the object we get an **instance** of a specific object.

**Exercise**:

Let's define a car object

characteristics \(nouns and adjectives\): make, model, color, year, max speed

what they can doe \(verbs\): start, stop, move forward, move in reverse, park

**Exercise**:

Code a car object
