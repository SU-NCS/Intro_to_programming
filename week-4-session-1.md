#### Activity 3: Libraries

#### Activity 4: Intro to Classes and Objects

**Objects** are nouns and can be described by their parts, or characteristics \(adjectives\) and what they can do \(verbs\)

**Classes** allow us to define code in the way we would define an object in real life.

The class code is a template for the object, and when we want to use the object we get an **instance** of a specific object.

**Exercise**:

Let's define a car class

characteristics \(nouns and adjectives\): make, model, color, year, max speed

what they can doe \(verbs\): start, stop, brake, move forward, move in reverse, park

#### Activity 5: Code a car class

Code a car object using Python language elements shown below

> **class**     defines the name of the object template
>
> **def**        This is how you define a data or method
>
> **\_\_init\_\_**  This is code that runs when we want to create a new instance of the class which is an object
>
> **return**    Some methods can return data as we learned with functions

**Exercise**:

Get the car object code running and add a function to increase speed.  The user
