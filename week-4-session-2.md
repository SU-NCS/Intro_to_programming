# Week 4: Session 2

_**GUI: Graphical User Interface**_

Most computer users interact with a GUI.  The command line is used by programmers and admins.  Python includes a library that creates a GUI.  We'll look at  how we can create a GUI using the Turtle library.  

GUI's rely on a window or canvas to draw on.  There is a 2 dimensional coordinate system where you can write pixels.  It is important to know the layout of this coordinate system so you can place your pixels in the intended location. The Turtle grid has is origin \(0,0\) in the middle of the canvas.

The way to think abut using Turtle is this: there is a turtle with a pen on its back and it walks around on the canvas.  When the pen goes down, the pixels are recorded on the canvas.  When the pen is up nothing is recorded.

The turtle can be programmed using all of the python data structures and commands that you have learned.
